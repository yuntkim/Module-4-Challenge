    "* \"Charter\" schools outperform \"distric\" schools in terms of student achievment, with higher average math and reading scores and hight percentages of students passing both math and reading rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Schools with smaller student number tend to perform better than larger schools. Specifically, schools with fewer than 1000 students perform best, followed by schools with 1000-2000 students, and then schools with 2000-5000 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no clear relationship between per-student spending and student achievement. In fact, the highest-performing schools tended to have lower per-student spending than some lower-performing schools.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The district has a total of 15 schools and 39,170 students. The average math score is 78.98, and the average reading score is 81.87. Overall, 74.98% of students passed math, 85.80% passed reading, and 65.17% passed both subjects. The distric has a budget of $24,649,428 and the average spending per student.\n",

    "* The top 5 performing schools are all charter schools, while the bottom 5 performing schools are all district schools. Charter schools have a higher average math and reading score, as well as a higher percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects compared to district schools. The total budget for charter schools is lower than district schools, but the average spending per student is higher for charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scores by School Spending**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schools with lower budget per studdent have higher overall passing percentage than school that spent higher. The highest overall passing percentage is for schools that spend less than $584 per student. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scores by School Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller schools tend to have higher overall passing percentages compared to larger schools. The highest overall passing percentage is for small schools with less than 1,000 students. Large schools with more than 2,000 students have the lowest overall passing percentage.\n",
